# Canaidoanything - Creative AI Instructions

This repository stores a collection of system prompts and instructions designed to enhance the creativity of AI models, particularly in the fashion domain.

## Overview

The goal is to provide a structured way to guide AI systems towards generating highly innovative and visually poetic outputs. The instructions are broken down into several files, catering to different aspects of creative generation and reasoning.

## Directory Structure

-   `creative_prompts/`: This directory contains the raw text files for different sets of creative instructions:
    -   `revolutionary_creative_ai.txt`: Core creative behavior instructions and enhanced creative directives.
    -   `flux_creative_system.txt`: Specific instructions tailored for FLUX image generation.
    -   `claude_gpt_creative_reasoning.txt`: Instructions for creative reasoning, potentially for models like Claude or GPT.
-   `creative_loader.py`: A Python script containing a utility function (`load_creative_instructions`) to load these instruction files. (Currently a placeholder).
-   `example.py`: Contains Python code snippets demonstrating how these instructions might be integrated or used in a system.

## Usage

The instruction files can be loaded and used to prime or guide AI models. The `creative_loader.py` provides a basic mechanism for this, and `example.py` shows conceptual usage.

To get started:
1. Explore the `.txt` files in the `creative_prompts` directory.
2. See `example.py` for how these might be used with Python code.
3. The `creative_loader.py` can be expanded to include actual file reading logic.

## Contributing

(To be defined - for now, this repository is primarily for storing and organizing these creative prompts.)
